## The Ancient Law - Ninja Game

This ninja-themed game, titled **"The Ancient Law"**, was built using my custom raycaster engine. If you're feeling creative, you can also design your own levels using the built-in level editor.

To run the game, you can use **XAMPP** or a similar software, but you can also access it directly here:

Happy coding or have fun gaming!
